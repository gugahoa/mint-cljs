* Building a static blog with ClojureScript and Reagent

This article is being written as I learn ClojureScript and create the blog which will host the article itself. It's a living organism.

First of all, there's only two things that will go into the compile step:
1. The index list, with title, summary, id and publishing date
2. The article content, which somehow I want to separate in different modules so that tree shaking can do the heavy lifting
